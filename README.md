# Labyrinth

If you want to test the game, please go to my itch.io page : [Al3xics](https://al3xics.itch.io/). Download the zip file named **"Labyrinth"**, decompress, and launch the .exe file.<br>
<br>

This project was made over a few weeks, and is about **trying the Unity API**.<br>
<br>

### Have fun !!
